# FinalProject

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic became the first non-influenza pandemic to affect more than 200 countries as declared in March of 2020. It has caused a worldwide panic since it negatively affected the economy, employment, healthcare systems, and more. In December 2020, the first COVID vaccine became FDA approved and available to those of 16 years and older which helped contribute to a decrease in hospitalizations all around the world as well as a reduction in cases.

## Overview

Our topic was to develop the analysis of vaccination efficiency and testing efficiency of COVID-19 worldwide. Given the new variants of COVID-19, it’s important to test the efficiency of vaccinations and tests in order to be able to analyze how these have affected the number of cases and deaths worldwide. Not only that, but we wanted to see the correlation between the number of cases confirmed and if that predicts the number of deaths. Another part of the project was to see the change in number of cases once the COVID-19 vaccine was released.
We decided to retrieve data from Our World in Data (OWID) as a provisional database as well as the geographical data from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database. Luckily enough, OWID began to use the data from JHU in November of 2020 so using both these databases won’t deter us from mixing data.
